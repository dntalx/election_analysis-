##Election Audit Summary

The script created for this audit can be used in future elections with some modifications depending on the election being used for. The script can handle having more counties, candidates, and votes added to the Excel sheet we were pulling the data from. With this, we can also modify the script to learn more information about the voters such as their party affiliation, if the votes came from mail-in ballots, punch cards, or direct recoding electronic.
